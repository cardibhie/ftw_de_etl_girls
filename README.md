# FTW DE: The ETL Girls 💙
This project explore trends using SQL, visualizations, and collaborative analysis.


## 📌 Project Overview
This is a data engineering project focused on building data pipelines, optimizing queries, and creating insightful visualizations.  
We leverage **ClickHouse** as our analytical database and **Metabase** for dashboards, all containerized with **Docker** for easy setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **ClickHouse** → Fast, columnar database for analytics.  
- **Metabase** → Visualization and BI tool for dashboards.  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** → Containerized setup for easy sharing.  
- **SQL** → Querying and performance testing.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cardibhie/ftw_de_etl_girls.git
cd ftw_de_etl_girls
```
### 2. Pull latest updates (DO THIS EVERY TIME BEFORE WORKING)
```bash
git pull origin main
```
### 3. Create own branch 
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name> #sample git checkout -b lou_branch 
```
### 4. Push to branch 
- Do this when you are sure that there are no conflicts and errors with your code. Consult me first when you are going to push your code. 
### 5. Switching branches 
``bash
git checkout main
git checkout feature/<branch-name>

✅ That way, everyone can:
- Pull the latest changes
- Work on their own branch
- Push without overwriting other people’s work
